_Startups sound exciting, right?_&nbsp; Coming up with a new idea or finding a unique problem to solve is a challenge - especially today, when nearly every concept seems to already exist somewhere in the world. And if you're building a startup in this competitive market, hats off to you!

Anyway, let me take you behind the scenes of _my journey building a full-stack SaaS application for a startup - from scratch, as a solo developer, and all the way to production._&nbsp;

### What is Tapify

Tapify redefines **networking with digital business cards** for modern teams. Unlike traditional cards, Tapify **cards use NFC and QR** technology, allowing users to instantly share contact details without needing an app.

> It’s as simple as “tap and share,” much like tap-to-pay services.

You can also store your Tapify card in **Apple or Google Wallet** for easy access.

Tapify combines innovation with environmental impact, replacing paper cards with a professional, eco-friendly solution.

### Process of Building

For me, it's not just about contributing - it's about taking full ownership of the project. At Tapify, I received the Figma design files, and as a solo developer, I was responsible for creating the logic and finding solutions.

I took on the task of building the entire user-facing web application. I handled everything from **frontend** to **backend**, as well as **security** and **performance**. Every issue was something I debugged and fixed on my own.

Here's a glimpse of my work:

### Tech Stack

Building **Tapify from the ground up** as the sole developer on the team, while **working closely with the founder**, was an **incredibly exciting experience**. **Every single line of code was written by me**, enabling me to quickly identify and resolve any bugs or issues that occurred.

I used a **cutting-edge tech stack** and followed industry best practices to keep the code **type-safe** and **maintainable for future updates** and changes.

### Launch Day Story

Launch day was both **exciting** and **challenging**! We faced an issue with data migration because of changes in the schema. It took a bit of time to fix, but once it was done, we quickly switched the domain and the web app started getting real user interactions.

Everything went smoothly - **no issues were reported by Tapify’s customers**.

The only minor issue was with certain customers email providers, which caused problems with magic link logins. I resolved it within a day by adding a verification route, similar to Vercel’s approach.

Here’s the midnight **message I got from the founder** on launch day:

### Learnings

> Ideas don't come out fully formed, they only become clearer as you work on them. - Mark Zuckerberg

To be honest, I learned a lot at Tapify. I gained a deeper **understanding of databases** and **database modeling**, as well as how to write **clean**, **maintainable**, and **type-safe code**.

When I started, I was a bit nervous about handling everything on my own, but over time I realized that no one is perfect from the beginning. You don’t need to be perfect to start, you just need a willingness to learn along the way.
